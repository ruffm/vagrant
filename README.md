Just playing with Vagrant. 

Works with VirtualBox. 

The Apache folder is running Ubuntu 16.04, and just has a simple script inside to update the VM and install apache2.

The GeoQ folder is running Centos 6.8, and has the install script from my [GeoQTools](https://github.com/ruffm/geoqtools) repository. It almost works as of right now (5/6/2017).
